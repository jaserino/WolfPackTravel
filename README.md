## Description

WolfPack Travel is a mock travel agency website that I created for learning purposes. WolfPack Travel makes it easy for anyone looking to plan their vacation stress free.
The website includes information similar to what a travel agency would have on their website
as well as a fully functioning form which is hosted by netlify.
